I'm currently working on this project, and I still have a lot of work. Those files were made public in order to share my work, but no documentation is available for now. You can contact me at the address above if you have questions. If you do not come from there, you can also see my blog: http://ikturm.wordpress.com/projects-2/current-projects/the-ocr-project/
